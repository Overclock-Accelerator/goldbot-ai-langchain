<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>The user wants to remove TypeScript checks on Vercel deployment. They're getting a TypeScript error during the build process.

There are two approaches here:
1. Fix the TypeScript error (the proper way)
2. Disable TypeScript checks during build (what the user is asking for)

Since the user explicitly asked to "remove typescript checks on vercel deployment", I should help them disable TypeScript checking during the build process.

In Next.js, you can disable TypeScript checking during build by modifying the `next.config.ts` (or `next.config.js`) file to add `typescript: { ignoreBuildErrors: true }` in the config.

Let me read the current next.config.ts file to see what's there and then modify it.</details></think>

I'll help you disable TypeScript checks during Vercel deployment. Let me first check your Next.js configuration file and then modify it to skip TypeScript validation during builds.

Tool use: **read_file**

Read file: next.config.ts

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Now I need to modify the next.config.ts file to add the typescript configuration that will ignore build errors. I'll add `typescript: { ignoreBuildErrors: true }` to the config object.</details></think>

Now I'll update the configuration to skip TypeScript checks during build:

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Good! I've successfully updated the next.config.ts file to disable TypeScript checks during build. This will allow Vercel to deploy successfully even with TypeScript errors.

However, I should also mention that this is a workaround and the proper fix would be to address the TypeScript error in the route.ts file. But since the user specifically asked to remove TypeScript checks, this is what they wanted.

The change I made adds the `typescript.ignoreBuildErrors` option to the Next.js config, which will skip TypeScript validation during the build process on Vercel.</details></think>

---

**Plan:**
Disable TypeScript checks during Vercel deployment by adding `ignoreBuildErrors: true` to the Next.js config.

**Changes Made:**

```4:9:next.config.ts
  /* config options here */
  typescript: {
    // ⚠️ Dangerously allow production builds to successfully complete even if
    // your project has type errors.
    ignoreBuildErrors: true,
  },
```

**Summary:**
Updated `next.config.ts` to skip TypeScript validation during builds. Vercel will now deploy successfully even with the type error in `route.ts`. The build process will ignore all TypeScript errors and proceed with deployment.
